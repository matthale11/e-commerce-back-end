# E-Commerce Back End
## Description
This E-Commerce back end application uses the Express, dotenv, mysql2, and Sequelize libraries to allow a user to manage an E-Commerce website using the command line and Insomnia. This includes retrieving, adding, editing, and deleting items from several tables within the site database. The database includes the following four tables:
- Category: categories for products
- Product: products to be sold
- Tag: descriptive keywords for products
- ProductTag: links products and tags
## Instructions
Open your terminal command line and run 'npm i' to install required NPM packages and then run 'npm start' to start the server running. Once the server is listening, use Insomnia Core to modify the tables in your database.
